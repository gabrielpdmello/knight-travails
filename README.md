# knight-travails

This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum.

The assignment is to build a function that shows the shortest possible path a knight can get from one square to another on a chessboard by outputting all the squares the knight will stop on along the way.

The chessboard can be represented as an unweighted graph, and the shortest path can be found using the breadth-first search algorithm and then reconstructing the path backwards from the given start and end vertices.
